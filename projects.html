		<h4><i>Research Project Leader</i></h4>
		<p class = "project-p">
			The primary purpose of this project was to create a database of integer sequences enumerating the number of paths from (0,0,0) to (n,n,n) using various sets of acceptable steps, and to examine the long-term/statistical behavior of such integer sequences. As the project leader, my responsibilities included being the head analyst, maintaining the database, and publishing the integer sequences that we found to be interesting into the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) 
		</p>
		<p class = "project-p">
			Throughout the duration of the project, the team found/examined integer sequences that were already in the OEIS and those that were not. Some of the integer sequences that the team found were already published in the OEIS, but did not already have our interpretation. Thus, some of our publications include comments to previously authored sequences, mentioning our interpretation of the sequence.
