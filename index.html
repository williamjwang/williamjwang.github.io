		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>Hello everyone! My name is William, and I started programming in the Fall of 2018, so I have only started programming recently. As of January 2020, I am a freshman at Rutgers University - New Brunswick. My dream career is to become a quant, specifically using mathematics, programming skills, and computer science knowledge to create and build algorithms and predictive models about the stock market.
		</p>
		<p>One of my favorite places on Rutgers is the Cook Student Center, a place where I study, hang out, eat, and play ping pong/pool at. I like to say that it's "where everything's at". I also like learning new things on my own, so I spend a lot of time on Udemy. I've learned some web design basics and basic things about HTML, and I am currently trying to learn Python and Excel (VBA).
